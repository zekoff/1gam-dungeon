Pick something from to-do list.

## To-do

- Add abilities and different player types.
- Add doors to rooms
- Add traps, locks, switches, and other dungeon features.
- Improve move markers
- Things to find in the dungeon
- Onscreen log showing activities ("Norbert is searching for secret passages...")
especially when one of your characters is idle.
- Transition between floors.
- Character select screen and results screen when both have died or you finish
the dungeon.
- Add logic to separate players that converge on the same tile
- Do a prepass phase for hallways, laying them down so that they are notated
differently in the internals of the map. Then, once you've got rooms and hallways
connected as you like, go back and convert them to the floor tile value before
doing the wall building.
- Add ability for rooms to know which rooms they are linked to.
- Lifebars for enemies and objects.

## Bugs

- Prevent enemies from spawning in same room as players.
